# Workshop Description


 The software engineering community has a strong history on symbolic methods (formal methods, programming languages, etc.) and, more recently, has been quickly adopting machine learning techniques in most of its tasks like automated program repair, program synthesis, code generation & summarization and verification planning.  Many have also taken note of the possibilities of combining the strengths of symbolic and learning techniques, for instance, in the engineering complex software in autonomic, self-adaptive systems, and multi-agents systems as well improving automated methods for bug fixing, code review, and test generation. 
    
We plan to collect experiences, challenges, and solutions involved in combining symbolic methods and machine learning to tackle new and traditional challenges of software engineering task from requirements to analysis & design, coding, testing, and maintenance & evolution. These contributions could be in the form of case studies, proofs-of-concept, new ideas and emerging results, evaluation of tools, controlled experiments with software engineers. e.g., specifying logical rules/constraints or utilizing machine learning recommendations.

Preliminary List of Topics

- Neuro-symbolic methods in automated software engineering tools, e.g., code & test generation, bug fixing, code summarization, code review, etc.
- Neuro-Symbolic agents to support collaboration and decision making in software teams.
- Neuro-Symbolic methods in validation and verification tools.
- Neuro-Symbolic methods for designing safety-mission-critical systems.
- Neuro-Symbolic methods for extracting and maintaining knowledge graphs for software engineering.
- Methods for reasoning about learning from software data.
- Methods for learning while reasoning about software, e.g., automatically & adaptively determine decision thresholds and magnitude of actions for a desired effect of a software tool & technique.
- Methods for applying prior symbolic or probabilistic knowledge to new or improved software tools & methods.

# Call for Papers

We welcome original research papers ranging between **4-8 pages** in length (not including references or supplementary materials) which is formatted according to the IJCAI guidelines [link](https://www.ijcai.org/authors_kit). Reviews are **double blind**, so no identifying information should be on the papers.

Please submit your paper at here: [Microsoft CMT site](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/NSAIJCAI2023/Submission/Index)

We also welcome extended abstracts of up to **2 pages** (not including references) that describe open problems and challenges in the area of Neuro-Symbolic Agent.

The papers will be non-archival, which means we welcome papers that have been published or submitted to other conferences and journals. However, authors are required to acknowledge their papers’ original appearance in such cases.

All accepted papers and extended abstracts will be presented as posters.

The program committee will select some papers for oral presentation.
There will be a poster session during the scheduled coffee breaks to facilitate discussions among attendees.

**Summary:**

- **Length: 4-8 pages (research paper), or 2 pages (extended abstract)**
- **Double blind**
- **Two types of accept: Accept (oral & poster), Accept (poster)**
- **Submission site: [Microsoft CMT site](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/NSAIJCAI2023/Submission/Index)**
