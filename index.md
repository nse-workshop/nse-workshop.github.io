# Workshop Description

Software engineering has a success history evolving symbolic techniques like formal methods and programming languages to solve increasingly challenging problems, as for instance, providing safety and performance guarantees for autonomous intelligent and mission-critical systems. With the availability of machine learning (ML) techniques, software engineering expanded its set of problems to study how learning from data can enable various tasks, e.g., from code summarization and generation to automatic program repair and formal verification.  
The integration of symbolic and machine learning techniques (coined neuro-symbolic methods) has opened novel methodological challenges that go beyond applying ML to build software (ML4SE) or applying software engineering to build ML (SE4ML). Neuro-Symbolic methods focus on problems of how to “reason while learning” and how to “learn while reasoning”.  
This workshop aims to discuss these problems in the context of the various software engineering tasks that have been recently transformed by the adoption of machine learning techniques. We invite insights on merging symbolic and ML techniques across the software development life-cycle, its activities, artifacts, metrics, and tools. We welcome case studies, conceptual approaches, empirical research, and more formal or theoretical considerations.   
    
We plan to collect experiences, challenges, and solutions involved in combining symbolic methods and machine learning to tackle new and traditional challenges of software engineering task from requirements to analysis & design, coding, testing, and maintenance & evolution. These contributions could be in the form of case studies, proofs-of-concept, new ideas and emerging results, evaluation of tools, controlled experiments with software engineers. e.g., specifying logical rules/constraints or utilizing machine learning recommendations.

Preliminary List of Topics

- Neuro-symbolic methods in automated software engineering tools, e.g., code & test generation, bug fixing, code summarization, code review, etc.
- Neuro-Symbolic agents to support collaboration and decision making in software teams.
- Neuro-Symbolic methods in validation and verification tools.
- Neuro-Symbolic methods for designing safety-mission-critical systems.
- Neuro-Symbolic methods for extracting and maintaining knowledge graphs for software engineering.
- Methods for reasoning while learning from software data.
- Methods for learning (including large language models) while reasoning about software artifacts and tasks, e.g., automatically & adaptively determine decision thresholds and magnitude of actions for a desired effect of a software tool & technique.
- Methods for applying prior symbolic or probabilistic knowledge to new or improved software tools & methods.
