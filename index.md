# Workshop Description

Software engineering has a success history evolving symbolic techniques like formal methods and programming languages to solve increasingly challenging problems like providing safety and performance guarantees for autonomous intelligent systems fulfilling mission-critical functions. With the availability of machine learning (ML) techniques, software engineering expanded its set of problems to how learning from data enables from code summarization and generation to automatic program repair and formal verification. 
The integration of symbolic and machine learning techniques has opened new novel methodological challenges that go beyond applying ML to build software (ML4SE) or applying software engineering to build ML (SE4ML).  These challenges fall under the umbrella of Neuro-Symbolic methods and comprise problems of how to - "reason while learning” and "learn while reasoning”. 
The workshop aims to discuss these problems in the context of software engineering tasks that have been transformed by the adoption of machine learning techniques. We invite insights on merging symbolic and ML techniques across the software development life-cycle, its activities, tasks, and tools. We welcome case studies, conceptual innovative approach descriptions, empirical research, and more formal or theoretical considerations.   
    
We plan to collect experiences, challenges, and solutions involved in combining symbolic methods and machine learning to tackle new and traditional challenges of software engineering task from requirements to analysis & design, coding, testing, and maintenance & evolution. These contributions could be in the form of case studies, proofs-of-concept, new ideas and emerging results, evaluation of tools, controlled experiments with software engineers. e.g., specifying logical rules/constraints or utilizing machine learning recommendations.

Preliminary List of Topics

- Neuro-symbolic methods in automated software engineering tools, e.g., code & test generation, bug fixing, code summarization, code review, etc.
- Neuro-Symbolic agents to support collaboration and decision making in software teams.
- Neuro-Symbolic methods in validation and verification tools.
- Neuro-Symbolic methods for designing safety-mission-critical systems.
- Neuro-Symbolic methods for extracting and maintaining knowledge graphs for software engineering.
- Methods for reasoning about learning from software data.
- Methods for learning while reasoning about software, e.g., automatically & adaptively determine decision thresholds and magnitude of actions for a desired effect of a software tool & technique.
- Methods for applying prior symbolic or probabilistic knowledge to new or improved software tools & methods.

# Call for Papers

NSE seeks submissions describing novel research, emerging ideas, work-in-progress describing original and unpublished results in the field of Neuro-symbolic methods for software engineering. 

The ICSE 2025 workshop proceedings will be prepared by IEEE CPS and published by ACM and follow the [instructions](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template) available using the double-column format. Research papers must have a maximum length of 6 pages. Short papers are limited to 4 pages. Industry demonstrations and extended abstracts must have a maximum lengths of 2 pages. There is no limit on the number of submissions an author may submit. We will follow a single-blind process, i.e., it is not required to anonymize the submission.

As per the standard ACM policies, all submissions should be original, i.e., they should not have been previously published in any conference proceedings, book, or journal and should not currently be under review for another archival conference. Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties. Papers must be submitted electronically by the defined deadline (see below).
